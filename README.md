#### Contributing to Beer ####
If you want to create a implemention of Beer for another framework or programming language, just upload it to GitHub and add it to this README.md file.
##### Versioning #####
Your library version number MUST follow the Beer versioning concept:

`BeerVersion . LibraryMajor . LibraryMinor (. LibraryPatch)`

The version number MUST consist of the Beer version and your library major and minor version. It's OPTIONAL to add the patch version of your library.

So if you publish your library version 2.3 which implements Beer version 0, your version number MUST be 0.2.3!
