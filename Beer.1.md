Beer Version 1
==============
```
TODO:
1. define Beer standards
2. publish Beer
3. watch the world burn
```

Version 1 will be a new milestone-release of the Beer enciphering standard. Beer is meant to be used in a non-critical environment, where loss, modification and/or manipulation of data don't lead to massive impacts on the product which uses it. In short terms: don't use this stuff in critical/high-security projects.  
As stated before, Beer is meant to be used an developed as an easy to understand way of enciphering (or more or less obfuscating) human readable data. However it is possible to use it for transferring data by converting the files to string-based formats (e.g. base64). We strongly encourage you to use beer in _any possible way there is_ and contribute to this project with your gathered knowledge, but advise you **not** to build apps with Beer used as **security layer**. (You _can_, we _do_; but we **strongly advise against it** because beer is **no encryption**).
